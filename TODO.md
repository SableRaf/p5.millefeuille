-[x] Include blend modes from https://github.com/jamieowen/glsl-blend/ (look at issues #3 Add Hue, Luminance, Saturation & Color Modes, #6 Blend Normal with Alpha, #12 Subtract mode error)
  - ✅ Installed glsl-blend and rollup-plugin-glslify
  - ✅ Replaced custom shaders with glsl-blend functions
  - ✅ Implemented ping-pong buffer compositing for proper blend mode support
  - ✅ Added 14 blend modes: Normal, Multiply, Screen, Add, Subtract, Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light, Color Dodge, Color Burn, Darken, Lighten, Difference, Exclusion
  - ✅ Updated compositor to use shader-based blending instead of p5.js blend modes
  - ⚠️ Note: Hue, Luminance, Saturation & Color modes are not available in glsl-blend (see issue #3)
